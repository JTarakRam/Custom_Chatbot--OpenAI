unique?\nAnswer: mysteryvibe is an award-winning world leader in medical devices for sexual health. launched in 2014, we create clinically proven, fda class 2 devices that deliver precise medical frequency vibrations to address various sexual health issues. these include genito-pelvic pain, penetration pain, arousal disorder, erectile dysfunction, delayed ejaculation and prostate health. our products are recommended by leading doctors at mayo clinic, cedar-sinai, rush hospital, nhs barts, king\u2019s college, charit\u00e9 and many others. sexual dysfunctions are commonplace, with 1 in 2 men suffering from erectile dysfunction and 4 in 5 women experiencing genito-pelvic pain. these problems are often associated with childbirth, menopause, aging, diabetes, heart disease, surgery, and cancer. however, most people suffer in silence and don't seek medical help. traditional medical solutions typically involve tablets, surgeries, or intrusive interventions.mysteryvibe addresses these issues using non-invasive vibratory stimulation, which increases blood flow to the affected areas and changes the messages carried by nerves. this can enhance sexual responsiveness and pleasure while decreasing pain. vibratory stimulation is also an essential component of many types of pelvic floor therapy to restore normal sexual function.our uniqueness and innovation lie in our patented technology, which combines malleable materials and electronics to create adaptable devices that suit various body shapes and deliver the right frequency vibrations exactly where needed. we currently have six fda class 2 medical devices in the market: crescendo 2 (genito-pelvic pain, penetration pain), poco (vulvodynia), legato (arousal disorder), molto (prostate health), tenuto 2 (erectile dysfunction) & tenuto mini (erectile dysfunction after prostatectomy).we differ from our competitors due to our breadth of focus on all major male and female sexual dysfunctions and our ability to access both the medical and consumer markets. we have achieved with the help of our 3 core competencies:\u2022\tend-to-end in-house product research, design, rapid prototyping, and pilot production, all performed at our r&d centre in surrey.\u2022\tintegrated partnerships with leading partners for medical studies, high-volume manufacturing, regulatory compliance, and electronics compliance.\u2022\ta proprietary technology stack in hardware, firmware, and software, developed and optimized with feedback from over 100,000 users.our innovation process begins by identifying what are the major sexual health issues that are affecting a large percentage of the population. then we dive deep into existing clinical literature to determine if vibration therapy can offer better solutions. we then collaborate with leading clinicians and patients to develop highly effective devices with the right characteristics, continuously iterating and testing until a robust & safe product is achieved with all the regulatory compliances. this process is conducted entirely in-house at our r&d centre,", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4123, "text_template":

from surgeries or cancer treatments, which often lead to sexual dysfunctions, find our products extremely helpful. by increasing blood flow and enhancing responsiveness through vibration therapy, our products offer non-invasive solutions to these prevalent sexual health issues.regardless of age or circumstances, our customers are people who value their sexual health and are seeking innovative, safe, and effective solutions to improve their quality of life and sustain their intimate relationships.\n\nQuestion: provide a study that demonstrates the evidence of effectiveness of mysteryvibe devices?\nAnswer: our best published study is on the use of our crescendo device for genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder (gpppd), a common condition after childbirth. gpppd causes painful sex, emotional distress, depression, as well as feelings of inadequacy and sexual frustration, which may gradually trigger problems with other domains of sexual functioning in the majority of diagnosed women.the study found that crescendo led to a 5x improvement in the sexual pain domain score of the fsfi, with no adverse effects related to the treatment. our goal is to make these devices extremely affordable at under $50 per unit and partner with hospitals and clinics to include them in the 'new mum kit' so every mum gets this device as soon as they have given birth and follow the simple instructions to address their pelvic pain easily, in the comfort, convenience and privacy of their home.you can find the publication here:

post-doc in biomedical engineering. he previously created a start-up in eye-recognition which was acquired by a us defence company. he then spent 7 years in management consulting on large technology projects. in 2014 soum started mysteryvibe to bring defence electronics and medical expertise together and create devices that solve big areas in sexual health in an accessible way. i am a biomedical engineer and entrepreneur with a passion for combining medicine and engineering to create purposeful products that improve people's lives. my greatest skill is connecting the dots \u2013 knowing who knows what and creating a nurturing team where passion and talent work together towards one common far-reaching goal. my interests lie in sexual health and leveraging technology to address significant healthcare challenges in a massively accessible way.i am a student for life \u2013 always deepening my understanding of things i know something of, and expanding my understanding into new areas i haven\u2019t explored before. this applies to everything i do \u2013 research, product design, marketing, sales, talent management, fundraising, and more. in the area of product design, where i spend most of my working days, my belief is best summarised by a quote from alain de botton, \u201celegance is a simplicity of design behind which you can intuit great complexity\u201d. delving a bit more the underlying principle behind all my work is the concept of \u2018enchanted objects\u2019. imagine harry potter\u2019s magic wand. on its own, it\u2019s just a piece of wood. powered by magic, it can defeat the gravest of enemies. similarly, the most mundane of everyday objects could be made enchanted when powered by the right technology. they can come to life at the right time to solve our everyday problems and go back to being normal objects thereafter. what if, our umbrellas could alert us on those misleading sunny mornings when it is about to pour in a few hours later. or medicine bottles reminding us of when it\u2019s time to take our tablets. the key to making objects enchanted is to make the transition friction-free. in the case of the umbrella and medicine bottle, all they need is a simple light or sound, informed by the internet and powered by ambient light.  self-contained, self-sufficient, no apps, no wires. they look and function like any other umbrella or medicine bottle, they just happen to be magical. my leadership philosophy is best explained as \u2018connected independence\u2019 \u2013 where team members across all parts of the business are connected, share learnings, discuss ideas, and have complete independence and ownership of their work. i believe this fosters innovation in a way structured and siloed hierarchies cannot.above all this, i am driven by one core value in everything i do \u2013 \u2018being kind\u2019. be kind, patient and understanding, even to strangers for we never know what people are going through. my greatest joy comes from seeing our work hugely change people's lives, and i am driven by a commitment to creating accessible solutions that can truly improve the lives of billions.\n\nQuestion: tell us about the journey of soum rakshit?\nAnswer: my professional career started during my phd years at university of bath where i was studying biomedical engineering. i was specialising in biometric eye recognition and the defence sector found our work valuable. so, we ended up creating a start-up to monetise our research. our company was acquired by a us defence company and that was the start of my accidental entrepreneurial journey. while i had a successful exit already, my expertise was limited to tech and felt the need to immerse myself in business and learn it properly. so, after our acquisition, i

acquisition, i joined deloitte consulting as a graduate. over the next 7 years i gained a breadth and depth of expertise in business and management. at the same time, i got to spend a lot of time listening to my colleague\u2019s pain points in relationships \u2013 especially after major life events like childbirth, menopause, cancer treatment or surgery. i realised that a major challenge in most people\u2019s lives is keeping the \u2018mystery\u2019 alive in a long-term relationship. i am a big believer in bringing together the best of medicine and engineering to create purposeful products that solve big healthcare challenges and significantly improve people\u2019s quality of life. so, i decided to combine my biomedical engineering expertise with leading doctors in urology and gynaecology to create mysteryvibe with the mission of normalising sexual health and making solutions for major sexual health issues accessible to all.for a while, i had been thinking about getting back to my first love, biomedical engineering. armed with the mission to create solutions in an area of healthcare that could change the lives of billions of people, i was ready to make the jump. this was something i was super passionate about so it was an easy decision to give up my corporate career and go back to start-up life. over the past decade at mysteryvibe, we have created 6 fda class 2 medical devices addressing genito-pelvic pain, penetration pain, erectile dysfunction, delayed ejaculation and prostate health. we have published 3 journal papers, won 30+ international awards, and are recommended by leading hospitals like charite, king\u2019s college, barts, mayo clinic, cedars-sinai and others.in my day to day work, i focus on actionable things that people can easily follow

using the buttons on the product.\n\nQuestion: what can i do with the app?\nAnswer: the app is a completely free add-on to widen your experience of the products. with the app you can change the

and save them onto your device for offline play.\n\nQuestion: can i create my own vibes?\nAnswer: you can create your own vibes on the mysteryvibe app. swipe down to the vibes menu and then tap on 'create'. from there, you can design your own vibration patterns, choosing the vibration pattern and intensity in each of the six motors indvidually. once you have created your own vibe, you can give

crescendo and tenuto on the app, swipe down to the vibes menu and then click the gear wheel at the top right corner. scroll down in the settings menu and you will see 'swap device'. here you can

phone is asking for a pin number when i try to connect. what should i do?\nAnswer: some android phones will prompt you to enter a pin number when connecting your crescendo or tenuto to the app. this pin number is assigned by your phone, not by the app as we don't have any pins in the app. the most common pins on android are 000000, 0000 and 1234. if you are still unable to connect, go to settings -> applications -> all -> bluetooth share and tap on force stop -> clear cache -> clear data. you should now be able to connect successfully.\n\nQuestion: when i connect to the app, why does it ask for access to my location?\nAnswer: google's android os updated the way their system works and now requires location to be enabled in order to use bluetooth. without giving location access it is no longer possible to use bluetooth devices with android phones. please note that this is an internal android function and our app doesn\u2019t use any location information or gather any data about your location.\n\nQuestion: when i connect to the app, it asks me to update my device. why is that?\nAnswer: we regularly release new features to improve reliability and make our products even more exciting. the update file is quite large and can take around 10 minutes to complete, however you will only need to do this once after an app update.\n\nQuestion: i can't access google play store, can

However, it can also be a source of anxiety and uncertainty, particularly when it comes to vulnerability. Many of us struggle to open ourselves up to our partners, fearing rejection or judgment. But what if vulnerability could actually enhance our sexual experiences? In this article, we explore the power of vulnerability in the context of sexual intimacy. We will discuss the benefits of embracing vulnerability, provide tips on how to cultivate it, and explore ways to enhance our sexual experiences through openness and authenticity.\u00a0\u00a0\nUnderstanding vulnerability\u00a0\nVulnerability involves opening oneself up to the possibility of emotional or physical harm. It requires trust in oneself and in others. In the context of sexuality, vulnerability can mean exposing one's sexual desires, fears, and insecurities to a partner. This can be challenging, as it requires individuals to trust their partners with this sensitive information. However, embracing vulnerability can also lead to greater connection and intimacy with a partner.\u00a0\nThe benefits of vulnerability\u00a0\nEmbracing vulnerability in one's sexual experiences can lead to several benefits. Firstly, it can lead to greater connection and intimacy with a partner. When individuals share their vulnerabilities with each other, it creates a deeper bond and understanding. It also opens you up to more meaningful and fulfilling sexual experiences.\u00a0\nSecondly, vulnerability can lead to greater sexual exploration and experimentation. When individuals feel safe and comfortable with their partners, they may be more willing to try new things and explore their sexuality. This can lead to new and exciting sexual experiences.\u00a0\nFinally, vulnerability can lead to greater self-awareness and personal growth. When individuals confront their fears and insecurities, they can learn more about themselves and their desires. Resulting in a greater sense of self-confidence and self-acceptance.\u00a0\nHow to embrace vulnerability\u00a0\nEmbracing vulnerability in one's sexual experiences can be challenging.

While traditional sex positions like missionary and doggy-style have their place, it's always good to spice things up with new positions. One such position is the 69 sex position. This position can be both intimate and pleasurable for both partners, but it does require some skill and technique. In this article, we will explore the ins and outs of the 69 sex position, including how to do it, the benefits, and some tips and tricks to make it more enjoyable.\u00a0\nGetting into the 69 position\u00a0\nThe 69 position involves simultaneous oral sex between partners, with one partner's genitals positioned over the other partner's face, while they reciprocate the act. To get into this position, both partners should lay on their sides facing each other, with their heads at opposite ends. From here, they can move closer until their genitals are positioned over each other's faces. Alternatively, one partner can lay on their back while the other straddles their face.\u00a0\nBenefits of the 69 position\u00a0\nOne of the primary benefits of the 69 position is that it allows both partners to receive oral sex simultaneously. This can be a great way to create intimacy and pleasure for both partners. Additionally, it allows for more equal participation in sexual activity, as both partners are giving and receiving pleasure at the same time.\u00a0\nTips and tricks for the 69 position\u00a0\nWhile the 69 position can be a great addition to any sexual repertoire, it does require some practice and technique to make it enjoyable. Here are some tips and tricks to help you get the most out of the 69 position:\u00a0\n1. Communication is key\nAs with any sexual activity, communication is essential. Make sure to communicate with your partner about what feels good and what doesn't.\u00a0\n2. Find a comfortable position\nThe 69 position can be uncomfortable if you're not in the right position. Experiment with different angles and positions to find what works best for you and your partner.\u00a0\n3.

Practice good hygiene\nOral sex requires good hygiene. Make sure to shower and clean your genitals before engaging in the 69 position.\u00a0\n4.

Take turns\nWhile simultaneous oral sex is the goal of the 69 position, taking turns can keep things interesting and prolong the experience.\u00a0\n6. Use sex toys\nIncorporating\u00a0sex toys\u00a0into the 69 position can add another layer of pleasure and excitement.\u00a0\n7. Don't forget about the rest of the body\nWhile the genitals are the primary focus of the 69 position, don't forget about the rest of the body. Kissing and touching other erogenous zones can enhance the experience.\u00a0\nPotential risks of the 69 position\u00a0\nAs with any sexual activity, there are potential risks associated with the 69 position. One of the primary risks is the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Oral sex can transmit STIs such as herpes, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. To reduce the risk of STI transmission, partners should use barriers such as dental dams or condoms.\u00a0\nAdditionally, the 69 position can be uncomfortable or even dangerous for those with certain health conditions. People with neck or back problems, respiratory issues, or pregnant women should avoid this position.\u00a0\nConclusion\u00a0\nThe 69 sex position can be a fun and exciting way to explore your sexual desires with your partner. However, it's essential to communicate and practice good hygiene to make it a pleasurable experience for both partners. Taking turns, using sex toys, and exploring other erogenous zones can enhance the experience. Like any sexual activity, there are potential risks associated with the 69 position, so it's important to take precautions to reduce the risk of STI transmission. Overall, the 69 position can be a great addition to your sexual repertoire if done safely and consensually.\n\nQuestion: A Beginner\u2019s Guide To Testicle Play\n\nAnswer: Testicle play is often a neglected aspect of male sexual pleasure. However, the testicles are a highly sensitive erogenous zone that can enhance sexual experiences when stimulated.\u00a0\nFor those curious about incorporating testicle play into their sexual repertoire, this guide offers a starting point for beginners looking to explore this underrated area of pleasure. With a focus on communication, consent, and experimentation, you can enjoy a new level of intimacy and pleasure with your partner:\u00a0\n1. Communication and consent\nAs with any sexual activity, communication and consent are crucial. Before engaging in testicle play with your partner, discuss your intentions and boundaries. Some people may be more sensitive or uncomfortable with the idea, while others may be eager to try it out. Ensure that both parties are on board and comfortable with the idea before proceeding.\u00a0\n2. Getting started\nBegin your foray into testicle play by exploring different sensations. Gently cup your partner's testicles in your hand and feel their weight and texture. Experiment with various pressures and motions, such as rolling the testicles between your fingers or gently squeezing them. Be sure to monitor your partner's reactions and adjust your actions accordingly. This exploration phase is key to understanding what your partner enjoys and what they may find uncomfortable.\u00a0\n3. Temperature play\nTemperature play can be an exciting way to stimulate the testicles and add a new dimension of pleasure. Try using a warmed massage oil or a cooling lubricant to heighten sensations. You can also experiment with items such as warmed towels or ice cubes. Always test the temperature on a less sensitive part of the body first, and be sure to communicate with your partner throughout the experience.\u00a0\n4. Oral stimulation\nOral stimulation is not just for the penis. The testicles can also enjoy the sensations provided by a warm, wet mouth. Try taking one of the testicles into your mouth and gently suck or lick it, being careful not to apply too much pressure.

You can also use your tongue to trace circles or lines on the scrotum or even hum gently while your mouth is around the testicle to create pleasurable vibrations.\u00a0\n5. Adding sex toys\nThere are numerous toys available on the market that cater specifically to testicle stimulation. Cock rings with attached testicle straps or separators can provide a unique sensation and can also prolong erections. Ball stretchers are another option, which applies gentle pressure to the testicles and can make them more sensitive. Finally, vibrating toys, such as bullet vibrators or wand massagers, can also be used to stimulate the testicles during foreplay or intercourse.\u00a0\n6. Safety considerations\nWhile testicle play can be a pleasurable addition to your sexual activities, it is essential to practice safety and care. The testicles are delicate and can be injured if mishandled. Always start with gentle pressure and work your way up, being mindful of your partner's reactions and pain thresholds. Avoid sharp objects, extreme temperatures, or overly tight restraints to prevent injury. In the event of pain or discomfort, stop immediately and communicate with your partner to determine the best course of action.\u00a0\nConclusion\u00a0\nTesticle play can open up a whole new world of pleasure for both partners. By incorporating these techniques and tips into your sexual routine, you can bring a new level of intimacy and enjoyment to your relationship. Remember to prioritize communication, consent, and safety above all else, and be open to experimenting and discovering new sensations together.

It's a very personal thing to review but I've barely got through any of the different setting. I never last that long! On the practical side, it's easy to operate and clean. It also looks fabulous in a very posh box and it's ergonomic.\n\nOla, DE\n\nAmazing product quality, it has been 3 years since the purchase, and each product works great and has not lost its quality!

Love everything they do - plus, best customer service I\u2019ve come across in years. Highly recommend.\n\nDan, GB\n\nIncredible toy (crescendo), blows my old ones out of the water. Was a little reluctant and first due to the hype around 6 motors and being able to control individually, but once you get the hang of it, nothing else can touch it. I was so pleased I ordered a Tenuto too, will review that shortly. Customer service excellent too, respond to queries quickly and efficiently.\n\nGabbi, GB\n\nAmazing products and really good customer service, have been buying from them since they launched Crescendo and they've never failed to deliver.\n\nHelen, GB\n\nBased on peer reviewed science and designed for everyone to use I\u2019ve been in touch to understand the science behind mystery vibe\u2019s product design. The founder sent across a few studies that the scientific community did, without the company paying for these studies. I was happy to see that the product was indeed designed to support people with different needs when it comes to their bodies and specific situation. This convinced me to add the company to my go-to list for sex health tech products.\n\nJax, GB\n\nSimply amazing, I was given this gadget as a gift and", "start_char_idx": 91802, "end_char_idx": 95795, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72d8af71-ded0-4026-8e41-be0db531ac49": {"__data__": {"id_": "72d8af71-ded0-4026-8e41-be0db531ac49", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fafa587d-6ecf-4a14-8197-8342560006dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "162b6c132fba0cde8b8cd975a8deed99f7195e762f8094b8fcb4c2b51cf852c4"}, "2": {"node_id": "65c5adfd-5a89-4dce-8cd4-06dcaf803ca1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "09d94067cd492a36d02ba3622fb83de563ee824e0f177ead744f82cbcdc13bcc"}, "3": {"node_id": "bb777387-84c6-4c36-a858-ded7b474c7fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce176d6dd966bbc2b8796c6e2f6bdccbc88992d367482495a4d1806c1a32be43"}}, "hash": "263dba0b351abd64401a2118c936d26ab080bc0f4155a90cb465f24956b8045d", "text": "GB\n\nSimply amazing, I was given this gadget as a gift and I can honestly say it\u2019s made a massive difference to my life and partners. We had a terrible sex life and this has simply turned it around, I\u2019m easily aroused by her and no need to take any ED pills.\n\nChad, GB\n\nThis thing really did blow my mind. Life changing. Amazing tech this has given me a new lease of life. Well done team.\n\nKaroline, US\n\nGreat fun - one of a kind sex toy! I bought a crescendo and have enjoyed discovering different ways to use it both solo and with my partner. Always a great time! Love that it is so versatile. A great way to add something fun and spice to the bedroom.\n\nKieran, GB\n\nSatisfied in more ways than one, good quality item and swift delivery. Wife seems pleased to say the least.\n\nFrank, USA\n\nThank you all for this revolutionary male toy! It is incredible. It really has helped in more ways than you can imagine - it's like I had a new penis replaced. You turned a 47 year old back into a 17 year old kid with testosterone flowing through his veins again.\n\nLaura, USA\n\nYou will not be disappointed! Using Poco is like having an ultra-thick, dual motor-controlled finger pleasure you, that unlike most human fingers, won\u2019t get tired. It\u2019s pretty perfect.\n\nKate, USA\n\nWith this toy, you are really only limited by your own imagination. The low settings mean you can use it for hours without the irritation of overstimulation, and the gradually building intensities make it fabulous to bring your orgasm home. It really will heighten your uniquely personal pleasure exploration!\n\nJohn, Kansas\n\nIt is working and I must say, it is working really well. I had a hysterectomy about 5 years ago and my doctor suggested it for blood circulation. It is perfect!\n\nEd, USA\n\nTenuto cured my age related delayed ejaculation. I purchased the Tenuto to help with a loss of sensation issue that is related to aging and being circumcised (delayed ejaculation). My urologist advised me to get a vibrator for the perineum to enhance sensation. The Tenuto has successfully enabled me to consistently climax once again.\n\nThomas, USA\n\nMy first impression of Tenuto is very positive. I've never used such a device before; I purchased Tenuto to see if it would help improve some minor men\u2019s health concerns that I have and I think that I got way more than I expected. Domo arigato, Mr. Tenuto! And thanks to MysteryVibe for creating such a revolutionary product!\n\nGerry, USA\n\nIt's thin, which makes it not as invasive as some wider toys, and the length is perfect for my clients who want to work on deep vaginal healing and need something to target all areas. This is something I'd recommend to them for that especially.\n\nMel, Kansas\n\nOverall, this is the best vibrator I have used for years and I am looking forward to exploring it further. This sex toy delivered the most intense orgasm I have had with a sex toy. It was incredible and to be honest, it took me completely by surprise. I wasn\u2019t expecting results like this.\n\nClaudia, USA\n\nThere are so many times when we wish we had a discreet, compact, powerful vibrator tucked away in the bedside drawer to play with, forget about the world and reach new levels of euphoria. That\u2019s exactly what I got from the poco vibrator! The best pocket vibrator in the market by far!\n\nMan of Many, USA\n\nThis thing feels good and I mean goooooood. It was as if my entire groin area was ensconced in a shell of tingling warmth. Not only was my orgasm better, but the effect lingered long afterwards. My groin and taint bathed in the remnants of climax, the tingles receding in steady waves as they trickled down to my toes.\n\nDr. Rubin, Washington", "start_char_idx": 95813, "end_char_idx": 99469, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb777387-84c6-4c36-a858-ded7b474c7fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb777387-84c6-4c36-a858-ded7b474c7fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fafa587d-6ecf-4a14-8197-8342560006dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "162b6c132fba0cde8b8cd975a8deed99f7195e762f8094b8fcb4c2b51cf852c4"}, "2": {"node_id": "72d8af71-ded0-4026-8e41-be0db531ac49", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "263dba0b351abd64401a2118c936d26ab080bc0f4155a90cb465f24956b8045d"}}, "hash": "ce176d6dd966bbc2b8796c6e2f6bdccbc88992d367482495a4d1806c1a32be43", "text": "waves as they trickled down to my toes.\n\nDr. Rubin, Washington D.C.\n\nFor the 75% of vagina owners who have reported experiencing discomfort during sex at least once, Crescendo could improve your experience in the bedroom.\n\nMarisa, New York\n\nSince the Crescendo is bendable, users are able to shape it to hit all the right nooks and crannies, essentially ridding themselves of the tension that can cause pain.", "start_char_idx": 99454, "end_char_idx": 99862, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"fafa587d-6ecf-4a14-8197-8342560006dd": {"node_ids": ["dac718dd-d5f3-4f70-b2c8-044d4740c1f0", "8572a981-bb28-4b6f-95ad-43025bfc4187", "21d96628-a3a8-46bb-8678-8c22541c01b4", "9464f5d7-65a6-4630-89f0-2da2b70fac8f", "cfa975e3-11a7-4232-aea2-724277b9461b", "be4e7efa-31d5-4f2c-ab9d-3a2793973d46", "4467e75f-6a3d-401f-88d8-df4034206166", "5fbe397b-d86e-40a5-a3ac-d7f956246337", "dc3d355f-6fad-4d4d-b545-46e7f64c85b9", "f69341d4-7e03-472b-9a0e-d752a219f310", "a36b4489-7d08-4af3-8c0a-dea1f5c452bf", "738d580c-8a37-45bc-86f5-83c0bbfa531e", "bc9e38d4-1295-4172-8aaf-ab1b5cb3e89b", "84821f72-7b79-4934-b2da-7d679c535554", "3b466f5e-ec71-4588-a02c-e529c5d39372", "005b98bc-0c76-4bf0-88ae-804dca63656e", "6ad94490-7281-46d7-8847-9b98ed4d8802", "1a052f79-c5d5-4a04-8707-e089220cfc49", "bc083b33-bad4-4779-b5d3-8263527df217", "bf98d527-ebd7-4a2d-9b37-ac0772699341", "dc24ba21-864a-4a3a-87fa-80355025ef54", "009a1f8e-8c1b-4dac-a6d0-3de9dfc30866", "1a232467-40c6-4acd-bcca-e7fd39b7bc15", "65c5adfd-5a89-4dce-8cd4-06dcaf803ca1", "72d8af71-ded0-4026-8e41-be0db531ac49", "bb777387-84c6-4c36-a858-ded7b474c7fa"], "metadata": {}}}}
