disorder, erectile dysfunction & prostate health.childbirth, menopause, diabetes, heart disease, cancer - all these life-events impact our sexual health. 50% men suffer from ed; 86% women suffer from genito-pain.we solve these through vibratory stimulation in a non-invasive way without side effects. our patented technology of malleable electronics adapts to the body and deliver targeted vibrations that increase blood flow to the affected areas & changes the message carried by the nerves. our devices have changed the lives of 100k patients, won 30 international awards, 35 patents & design registrations and published 3 papers in the journal of sexual medicine. they are recommended by mayo clinic, cedar-sinai, nhs, charité & others.\\n\\nQuestion: what makes mysteryvibe unique?\\nAnswer: mysteryvibe is an award-winning world leader in medical devices for sexual health. launched in 2014, we create clinically proven, fda class 2 devices that deliver precise medical frequency vibrations to address various sexual health issues. these include genito-pelvic pain, penetration pain, arousal disorder, erectile dysfunction, delayed ejaculation and prostate health. our products are recommended by leading doctors at mayo clinic, cedar-sinai, rush hospital, nhs barts, king’s college, charité and many others. sexual dysfunctions are commonplace, with 1 in 2 men suffering from erectile dysfunction and 4 in 5 women experiencing genito-pelvic pain. these problems are often associated with childbirth, menopause, aging, diabetes, heart disease, surgery, and cancer. however, most people suffer in silence and don't seek medical help. traditional medical solutions typically involve tablets, surgeries, or intrusive interventions.mysteryvibe addresses these issues using non-invasive vibratory stimulation, which increases blood flow to the affected areas and changes the messages carried by nerves. this can enhance sexual responsiveness and pleasure while decreasing pain. vibratory stimulation is also an essential component of many types of pelvic floor therapy to restore normal sexual function.our uniqueness and innovation lie in our patented technology, which combines malleable materials and electronics to create adaptable devices that suit various body shapes and deliver the right frequency vibrations exactly where needed. we currently have six fda class 2 medical devices in the market: crescendo 2 (genito-pelvic pain, penetration pain), poco (vulvodynia), legato (arousal disorder), molto (prostate health), tenuto 2 (erectile dysfunction) & tenuto mini (erectile dysfunction after prostatectomy).we differ from our competitors due to our breadth of focus on all major male and female sexual dysfunctions and our ability to access both the medical and consumer markets. we have achieved with the help of our 3 core competencies:•\\tend-to-end in-house product research, design, rapid prototyping, and pilot production, all performed at our r&d centre in surrey.•\\tintegrated partnerships with leading partners for medical studies, high-volume manufacturing, regulatory compliance, and electronics compliance.•\\ta proprietary technology stack in hardware, firmware, and software, developed and optimized with feedback from over 100,000 users.our innovation process begins by identifying what are the major sexual health issues that are affecting a large percentage of the population. then we dive deep into existing clinical literature to determine if vibration therapy can offer better solutions. we then collaborate with leading clinicians and patients to develop highly effective devices with the right characteristics, continuously iterating and testing until a robust & safe product is achieved with all the regulatory compliances. this process is conducted entirely in-house at our r&d centre, allowing us to rapidly iterate and develop products while owning all intellectual property.with our innovative products,

health devices, delivering highly effective and extremely affordable solutions to improve the lives of a billions of people worldwide.\\n\\nQuestion: what problem is mysteryvibe trying to solve?\\nAnswer: sexual dysfunctions are commonplace, with 50% of men suffering from ed and 80% of women experiencing genito-pelvic pain. these problems are associated with childbirth, menopause, diabetes, heart disease, surgery, and cancer. however, most people suffer in silence and don't seek medical help. traditional medical solutions typically involve tablets, surgeries, or intrusive interventions.we address these issues using non-invasive vibratory stimulation, which increases blood flow to the affected areas and changes the messages carried by nerves. this can enhance sexual responsiveness and pleasure while decreasing pain. vibratory stimulation is also an essential component of many types of pelvic floor therapy to restore normal sexual function.our uniqueness lie in our patented technology, which combines malleable materials & electronics to create adaptable devices that suit various body shapes and deliver the right frequency vibrations precisely where needed. a key factor behind this not being solved before is lack of funding and taboos surrounding sexual health.\\n\\nQuestion: who are mysteryvibe's target customers?\\nAnswer: our customers are anyone post-major-life-event. for example, people suffering from pelvic pain after childbirth, dryness / arousal disorder after or during menopause, erectile dysfunction after prostate cancer surgery. our customers also include individuals experiencing sexual health difficulties as they age, particularly those dealing with chronic conditions such as heart disease and diabetes. these health issues can often lead to problems like dryness, arousal disorder, reduced libido or erectile dysfunction. moreover, individuals recovering from surgeries or cancer treatments, which often lead to sexual dysfunctions, find our products extremely helpful. by increasing blood flow and enhancing responsiveness through vibration therapy, our products offer non-invasive solutions to these prevalent sexual health issues.regardless of age or circumstances, our customers are people who value their sexual health and are seeking innovative, safe, and effective solutions to improve their quality of life and sustain their intimate relationships.\\n\\nQuestion: provide a study that demonstrates the evidence of effectiveness of mysteryvibe devices?\\nAnswer: our best published study is on the use of our crescendo device for genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder (gpppd), a common condition after childbirth. gpppd causes painful sex, emotional distress, depression, as well as feelings of inadequacy and sexual frustration, which may gradually trigger problems with other domains of sexual functioning in the majority of diagnosed women.the study found that crescendo led to a 5x improvement in the sexual pain domain score of the fsfi, with no adverse effects related to the treatment. our goal is to make these devices extremely affordable at under $50 per unit and partner with hospitals and clinics to include them in the 'new mum kit' so every mum gets this device as soon as they have given birth and follow the simple instructions to address their pelvic pain easily, in the comfort, convenience and privacy of their home.you can find the publication here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/s1743609522015867\\n\\nQuestion: who are mysteryvibe's top 3 clinician key opinion leaders?\\nAnswer: dr. rachel rubin, veterans associationdr. tali sobel, mayo clinicdr. alexandra dubinskaya, cedars-sinai\\n\\nQuestion: who are mysteryvibe's current and potential competitors?\\nAnswer: we operate in a unique space that spans the intersection of sexual health, medical technology, and consumer electronics. therefore, our competitive landscape is diverse, and potential competitors could come from any of these sectors.in the medical sector, competitors include clinical devices makers like viberect, ferticare and silk’n. competitors also include pharmaceuticals that offer traditional treatments like sildenafil, tadalafil, etc. these solutions, while effective for some, often come with side effects or risks that many patients would prefer to avoid.in the consumer electronics sector, numerous companies produce vibrators and other sexual wellness products. however, they do not have medical credibility, and lack our depth of engineering expertise. our r&d centre is renowned globally and has been featured on popular science (https://www.popsci.com/health/sex-toys-medical-devices/?editn422=habsa) and the guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/09/how-sex-tech-firms-are-reinventing-the-vibrator).what sets us apart is our unique combination of deep clinical research, focus on sexual health, and innovative, non-invasive vibratory therapy devices. our approach to creating customizable, versatile devices backed by medical credibility, allows us to uniquely address multiple major sexual dysfunctions in a way no single competitor currently does. our devices are designed with a deep understanding of anatomy, which ensures that they can precisely target the right areas with the appropriate frequency and amplitude of vibrations. this, combined with the fact that we operate in both the medical and consumer markets, further reinforces our distinctive position in the market.\\n\\nQuestion: tell us about the growth of mysteryvibe\\nAnswer: we have consistently outperformed our growth plan by delivering on average 100% yoy growth since we started our sales in 2019

ceo of mysteryvibe. he has a phd & post-doc in biomedical engineering. he previously created a start-up in eye-recognition which was acquired by a us defence company. he then spent 7 years in management consulting on large technology projects. in 2014 soum started mysteryvibe to bring defence electronics and medical expertise together and create devices that solve big areas in sexual health in an accessible way. i am a biomedical engineer and entrepreneur with a passion for combining medicine and engineering to create purposeful products that improve people's lives. my greatest skill is connecting the dots – knowing who knows what and creating a nurturing team where passion and talent work together towards one common far-reaching goal. my interests lie in sexual health and leveraging technology to address significant healthcare challenges in a massively accessible way.i am a student for life – always deepening my understanding of things i know something of, and expanding my understanding into new areas i haven’t explored before. this applies to everything i do – research, product design, marketing, sales, talent management, fundraising, and more. in the area of product design, where i spend most of my working days, my belief is best summarised by a quote from alain de botton, “elegance is a simplicity of design behind which you can intuit great complexity”. delving a bit more the underlying principle behind all my work is the concept of ‘enchanted objects’. imagine harry potter’s magic wand. on its own, it’s just a piece of wood. powered by magic, it can defeat the gravest of enemies. similarly, the most mundane of everyday objects could be made enchanted when powered by the right technology. they can come to life at the right time to solve our everyday problems and go back to being normal objects thereafter. what if, our umbrellas could alert us on those misleading sunny mornings when it is about to pour in a few hours later. or medicine bottles reminding us of when it’s time to take our tablets. the key to making objects enchanted is to make the transition friction-free. in the case of the umbrella and medicine bottle, all they need is a simple light or sound, informed by the internet and powered by ambient light.  self-contained, self-sufficient, no apps, no wires. they look and function like any other umbrella or medicine bottle, they just happen to be magical. my leadership philosophy is best explained as ‘connected independence’ – where team members across all parts of the business are connected, share learnings, discuss ideas, and have complete independence and ownership of their work. i believe this fosters innovation in a way structured and siloed hierarchies cannot.above all this, i am driven by one core value in everything i do – ‘being kind’. be kind, patient and understanding, even to strangers for we never know what people are going through. my greatest joy comes from seeing our work hugely change people's lives, and i am driven by a commitment to creating accessible solutions that can truly improve the lives of billions.\\n\\nQuestion: tell us about the journey of soum rakshit?\\nAnswer: my professional career started during my phd years at university of bath where i was studying biomedical engineering. i was specialising in biometric eye recognition and the defence sector found our work valuable. so, we ended up creating a start-up to monetise our research. our company was acquired by a us defence company and that was the start of my accidental entrepreneurial journey. while i had a successful exit already, my expertise was limited to tech and felt the need to immerse myself in business and learn it properly. so, after our acquisition, i joined deloitte consulting as a graduate. over the next 7 years i gained a breadth and depth of expertise in business and management. at the same time, i got to spend a lot of time listening to my colleague’s pain points in relationships – especially after major life events like childbirth, menopause, cancer treatment or surgery. i realised that a major challenge in most people’s lives is keeping the ‘mystery’ alive in a long-term relationship. i am a big believer in bringing together the best of medicine and engineering to create purposeful products that solve big healthcare challenges and significantly improve people’s quality of life. so, i decided to combine my biomedical engineering expertise with leading doctors in urology and gynaecology to create mysteryvibe with the mission of normalising sexual health and making solutions for major sexual health issues accessible to all.for a while, i had been thinking about getting back to my first love, biomedical engineering. armed with the mission to create solutions in an area of healthcare that could change the lives of billions of people, i was ready to make the jump. this was something i was super passionate about so it was an easy decision to give up my corporate career and go back to start-up life. over the past decade at mysteryvibe, we have created 6 fda class 2 medical devices addressing genito-pelvic pain, penetration pain, erectile dysfunction, delayed ejaculation and prostate health. we have published 3 journal papers, won 30+ international awards, and are recommended by leading hospitals like charite, king’s college, barts, mayo clinic, cedars-sinai and others.in my day to day work, i focus on actionable things that people can easily follow and bring about real improvements in their health, lives and relationships. the greatest joy i get is in seeing our work improve people's lives.\\n\\nQuestion: tell us about mysteryvibe's crescendo device?\\nAnswer: crescendo is the world’s first ultra-flexible

However, it can also be a source of anxiety and uncertainty, particularly when it comes to vulnerability. Many of us struggle to open ourselves up to our partners, fearing rejection or judgment. But what if vulnerability could actually enhance our sexual experiences? In this article, we explore the power of vulnerability in the context of sexual intimacy. We will discuss the benefits of embracing vulnerability, provide tips on how to cultivate it, and explore ways to enhance our sexual experiences through openness and authenticity.\\xa0\\xa0\\nUnderstanding vulnerability\\xa0\\nVulnerability involves opening oneself up to the possibility of emotional or physical harm. It requires trust in oneself and in others. In the context of sexuality, vulnerability can mean exposing one's sexual desires, fears, and insecurities to a partner. This can be challenging, as it requires individuals to trust their partners with this sensitive information. However, embracing vulnerability can also lead to greater connection and intimacy with a partner.\\xa0\\nThe benefits of vulnerability\\xa0\\nEmbracing vulnerability in one's sexual experiences can lead to several benefits. Firstly, it can lead to greater connection and intimacy with a partner. When individuals share their vulnerabilities with each other, it creates a deeper bond and understanding. It also opens you up to more meaningful and fulfilling sexual experiences.\\xa0\\nSecondly, vulnerability can lead to greater sexual exploration and experimentation. When individuals feel safe and comfortable with their partners, they may be more willing to try new things and explore their sexuality. This can lead to new and exciting sexual experiences.\\xa0\\nFinally, vulnerability can lead to greater self-awareness and personal growth. When individuals confront their fears and insecurities, they can learn more about themselves and their desires. Resulting in a greater sense of self-confidence and self-acceptance.\\xa0\\nHow to embrace vulnerability\\xa0\\nEmbracing vulnerability in one's sexual experiences can be challenging. Here are some tips on how to do so:\\xa0\\n1. Build trust:\\xa0Vulnerability requires trust. Building trust with a partner is essential for embracing vulnerability. This can involve open communication, honesty, and respect.\\n2. Start small:\\xa0Embracing vulnerability doesn't have to mean sharing every intimate detail with a partner. Start small by sharing something small and gradually build up to more significant disclosures.\\n3. Be present:\\xa0Embracing vulnerability requires being present in the moment. This means letting go of distractions and fully focusing on the experience at hand.\\n\\xa04. Practice self-care:\\xa0Vulnerability can be emotionally draining. Practicing self-care, such as taking time for oneself or engaging in activities that bring joy, can help individuals recharge and feel more prepared to embrace vulnerability.\\nEnhancing sexual experiences through vulnerability\\xa0\\nEmbracing vulnerability can lead to enhanced sexual experiences. Here are some ways to enhance sexual experiences through vulnerability:\\xa0\\n1. Communicate:\\xa0Vulnerability requires open communication. Communicating one's desires, fears, and insecurities with a partner can lead to more meaningful and fulfilling sexual experiences.\\n2. Try new things:\\xa0Embracing vulnerability can lead to greater sexual exploration and experimentation. Trying new things and stepping out of one's comfort zone can lead to new and exciting sexual experiences.\\n3. Focus on pleasure:\\xa0Embracing vulnerability can lead to a greater focus on pleasure. When individuals feel safe and comfortable with their partners, they may be more willing to explore their desires and focus on pleasure.\\n4. Embrace imperfection:\\xa0Vulnerability involves embracing imperfection. Recognizing and accepting imperfection in oneself and one's partner can lead to greater self-acceptance and a more positive sexual experience.\\nConclusion\\xa0\\nEmbracing vulnerability in sexual experiences can lead to greater connection, intimacy, and personal growth. It requires trust, open communication, and a willingness to step out of one's comfort zone. Additionally, enhancing our sexual experiences through vulnerability can lead to a greater understanding of our own desires and needs. It's important to remember that vulnerability is never a sign of weakness but rather a strength that can actually lead to a more fulfilling and satisfying sexual life. By embracing vulnerability, individuals can enhance their sexual experiences and deepen their connections with their partners.\\n\\nQuestion: The Ins And Outs Of The 69 Sex Position\\nAnswer: Sexual exploration and experimentation are essential ingredients for a healthy sex life. While traditional sex positions like missionary and doggy-style have their place, it's always good to spice things up with new positions. One such position is the 69 sex position. This position can be both intimate and pleasurable for both partners, but it does require some skill and technique. In this article, we will explore the ins and outs of the 69 sex position, including how to do it, the benefits, and some tips and tricks to make it more enjoyable.\\xa0\\nGetting into the 69 position\\xa0\\nThe 69 position involves simultaneous oral sex between partners, with one partner's genitals positioned over the other partner's face, while they reciprocate the act. To get into this position, both partners should lay on their sides facing each other, with their heads at opposite ends. From here, they can move closer until their genitals are positioned over each other's faces. Alternatively, one partner can lay on their back while the other straddles their face.\\xa0\\nBenefits of the 69 position\\xa0\\nOne of the primary benefits of the 69 position is that it allows both partners to receive oral sex simultaneously. This can be a great way to create intimacy and pleasure for both partners. Additionally, it allows for more equal participation in sexual activity, as both partners are giving and receiving pleasure at the same time.\\xa0\\nTips and tricks for the 69 position\\xa0\\nWhile the 69 position can be a great addition to any sexual repertoire, it does require some practice and technique to make it enjoyable. Here are some tips and tricks to help you get the most out of the 69 position:\\xa0\\n1. Communication is key\\nAs with any sexual activity, communication is essential. Make sure to communicate with your partner about what feels good and what doesn't.\\xa0\\n2. Find a comfortable position\\nThe 69 position can be uncomfortable if you're not in the right position. Experiment with different angles and positions to find what works best for you and your partner.\\xa0\\n3. Practice good hygiene\\nOral sex requires good hygiene. Make sure to shower and clean your genitals before engaging in the 69 position.\\xa0\\n4. Use your hands\\nWhile oral sex is the primary focus of the 69 position, using your hands to stimulate your partner's genitals can enhance the experience.\\xa0\\n5. Take turns\\nWhile simultaneous oral sex is the goal of the 69 position, taking turns can keep things interesting and prolong the experience.\\xa0\\n6. Use sex toys\\nIncorporating\\xa0sex toys\\xa0into the 69 position can add another layer of pleasure and excitement.\\xa0\\n7. Don't forget about the rest of the body\\nWhile the genitals are the primary focus of the 69 position, don't forget about the rest of the body. Kissing and touching other erogenous zones can enhance the experience.\\xa0\\nPotential risks of the 69 position\\xa0\\nAs with any sexual activity, there are potential risks associated with the 69 position. One of the primary risks is the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Oral sex can transmit STIs such as herpes, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. To reduce the risk of STI transmission, partners should use barriers such as dental dams or condoms.\\xa0\\nAdditionally, the 69 position can be uncomfortable or even dangerous for those with certain health conditions. People with neck or back problems, respiratory issues, or pregnant women should avoid this position.\\xa0\\nConclusion\\xa0\\nThe 69 sex position can be a fun and exciting way to explore your sexual desires with your partner. However, it's essential to communicate and practice good hygiene to make it a pleasurable experience for both partners. Taking turns, using sex toys, and exploring other erogenous zones can enhance the experience. Like any sexual activity, there are potential risks associated with the 69 position, so it's important to take precautions to reduce the risk of STI transmission. Overall, the 69 position can be a great addition to your sexual repertoire if done safely and consensually.\\n\\nQuestion: A Beginner’s Guide To Testicle Play\\n\\nAnswer: Testicle play is often a neglected aspect of male sexual pleasure. However, the testicles are a highly sensitive erogenous zone that can enhance sexual experiences when stimulated.\\xa0\\nFor those curious about incorporating testicle play into their sexual repertoire, this guide offers a starting point for beginners looking to explore this underrated area of pleasure. With a focus on communication, consent, and experimentation, you can enjoy a new level of intimacy and pleasure with your partner:\\xa0\\n1. Communication and consent\\nAs with any sexual activity, communication and consent are crucial. Before engaging in testicle play with your partner, discuss your intentions and boundaries. Some people may be more sensitive or uncomfortable with the idea, while others may be eager to try it out. Ensure that both parties are on board and comfortable with the idea before proceeding.\\xa0\\n2. Getting started\\nBegin your foray into testicle play by exploring different sensations. Gently cup your partner's testicles in your hand and feel their weight and texture. Experiment with various pressures and motions, such as rolling the testicles between your fingers or gently squeezing them. Be sure to monitor your partner's reactions and adjust your actions accordingly. This exploration phase is key to understanding what your partner enjoys and what they may find uncomfortable.\\xa0\\n3. Temperature play\\nTemperature play can be an exciting way to stimulate the testicles and add a new dimension of pleasure. Try using a warmed massage oil or a cooling lubricant to heighten sensations. You can also experiment with items such as warmed towels or ice cubes. Always test the temperature on a less sensitive part of the body first, and be sure to communicate with your partner throughout the experience.\\xa0\\n4. Oral stimulation\\nOral stimulation is not just for the penis. The testicles can also enjoy the sensations provided by a warm, wet mouth. Try taking one of the testicles into your mouth and gently suck or lick it, being careful not to apply too much pressure. You can also use your tongue to trace circles or lines on the scrotum or even hum gently while your mouth is around the testicle to create pleasurable vibrations.\\xa0\\n5. Adding sex toys\\nThere are numerous toys available on the market that cater specifically to testicle stimulation. Cock rings with attached testicle straps or separators can provide a unique sensation and can also prolong erections. Ball stretchers are another option, which applies gentle pressure to the testicles and can make them more sensitive. Finally, vibrating toys, such as bullet vibrators or wand massagers, can also be used to stimulate the testicles during foreplay or intercourse.\\xa0\\n6. Safety considerations\\nWhile testicle play can be a pleasurable addition to your sexual activities, it is essential to practice safety and care. The testicles are delicate and can be injured if mishandled. Always start with gentle pressure and work your way up, being mindful of your partner's reactions and pain thresholds. Avoid sharp objects, extreme temperatures, or overly tight restraints to prevent injury. In the event of pain or discomfort, stop immediately and communicate with your partner to determine the best course of action.\\xa0\\nConclusion\\xa0\\nTesticle play can open up a whole new world of pleasure for both partners. By incorporating these techniques and tips into your sexual routine, you can bring a new level of intimacy and enjoyment to your relationship. Remember to prioritize communication, consent, and safety above all else, and be open to experimenting and discovering new sensations together.
